# Billing-System-Java


#### 1. **Architecture**
   - The system follows a **layered architecture**:
     - **Presentation Layer:** Java Swing is used to create a user-friendly graphical interface.
     - **Business Logic Layer:** The core functionalities for managing products, transactions, and stock are implemented using object-oriented programming.
     - **Data Access Layer:** JDBC is used to manage communication with the database for product and transaction data.

#### 2. **Modules**

##### 2.1 Admin Module
   - **Add Product:** Admins can add new products by entering details like name, price, and initial stock.
   - **Update Stock:** The system allows Admins to increase or decrease product stock based on new inventory or sales data.
   - **Update Price:** Admins can adjust the pricing of products in real-time.

##### 2.2 Billing Clerk Module
   - **Start Transaction:** The Billing Clerk can initiate a new customer transaction.
   - **Add to Cart:** Products can be added to the cart by scanning or entering product details.
   - **Apply Discount:** Discounts can be applied either as a percentage or a fixed amount.
   - **Calculate Total:** The system automatically calculates the total after discounts.
   - **Generate Invoice:** A detailed invoice is generated that lists all purchased products, applied discounts, and the final amount to be paid.
   - **Complete Transaction:** Once a transaction is completed, the stock is updated, and the transaction is saved in the database.

#### 3. **User Interface**
   - **Java Swing:** The graphical user interface (GUI) is built with Java Swing for cross-platform compatibility.
     - **Admin Interface:** Provides menus for product management (add, update, delete products, stock, and price adjustments).
     - **Billing Clerk Interface:** Simplified interface for processing transactions with options to add items to the cart, apply discounts, and print invoices.

#### 4. **Database Design**
   - A **relational database** is designed to store product data, stock levels, user roles, and transaction history.
   - Tables:
     - **Products Table:** Stores product ID, name, description, price, and stock.
     - **Transactions Table:** Records transaction details, including product list, discounts applied, and total amount.
     - **Users Table:** Stores admin and billing clerk credentials with role-based access control.

#### 5. **Security**
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admins and Billing Clerks have distinct roles and access levels:
     - Admins can add or modify products and stock.
     - Billing Clerks can only process transactions and generate bills.
   - **Authentication:** Simple authentication mechanism to differentiate between Admin and Billing Clerk users at login.

#### 6. **Technology Stack**
   - **Frontend:** Java Swing for building the GUI.
   - **Backend:** Java for business logic and data processing.
   - **Database:** MySQL , integrated using JDBC for data persistence.

#### 7. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - Error handling mechanisms are integrated to catch and report issues during transactions, stock updates, and database operations.
   - **Logging:** A logging system is set up to record system activity, errors, and important events for debugging purposes.

#### 8. **Scalability**
   - The system is designed with scalability in mind, making it easy to add new features like customer profiles, more detailed reports, and product categories.

#### 9. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing:** Individual components like product management, transaction processing, and stock updates were tested using JUnit.
   - **Integration Testing:** Testing was done to ensure smooth interaction between the user interface, business logic, and database.

#### 10. **Deployment**
   - The system can be deployed on any platform supporting Java.
   - A **standalone desktop application** designed for small to medium-sized retail businesses.

This solution provides a reliable, efficient, and easy-to-use platform for retail billing, allowing Admins to manage products and stock while enabling Billing Clerks to process transactions and generate bills effectively.
